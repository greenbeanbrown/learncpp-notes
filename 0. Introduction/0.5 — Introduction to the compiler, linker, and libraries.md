# # 0.5 â€” Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries

### Compiling your source code

Every time you compile C++ code, the compiler sequentially goes through each .cpp file and does 2 important tasks:
	1. It checks your code to make sure it follows the rules of the C++ language
		- If it does not, the compiler will give you an error with the line number
		- The compilation process will also be aborted
	2. It translates your C++ code into a machine language file called an **object file** 
		- Object files are typically named **name.o** or **name.obj**, where name is the same name as the .cpp file it was produced from


### Linking object files and libraries
After the compiler creates one or more object files, another program called the **linker** kicks in. After linking, an executable file remains that can be run

The job of the linker is 3-fold:
	1. Take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single .exe
	2. Then link all the library files (i.e. imported packages used)
	3. The linker makes sure all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly
		- i.e. if you define something in one file and use it in another, the linker will connect the two together
			- If it's unable to link them, then you will get an error

### Random note about makefile
Some development environments offer **makefile** functionality for complex projects
	- This is a file that describes which files to compile and link, and how to go about that exactly
