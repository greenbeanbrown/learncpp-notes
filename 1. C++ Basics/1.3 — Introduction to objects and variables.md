# 1.3 — Introduction to objects and variables


### Objects and variables
- All computers have memory, called **RAM** (Random Access Memory), that is available for your programs to use.
	- You can think of  RAM as a series of numbered mailboxes that can each be used to hold a piece of data while the program is running.
		- A single piece of data, stored in RAM somewhere, is called a **value**
- In some older languages, you could actually access individual mailboxes by index 
- In C++ direct memory access is not allowed
	- Instead we use objects, which store values


### Variable instantiation
In order to create a variable, we use a special kind of declaration statement called a **definition** 

Here’s an example of defining a variable named x:

```cpp
int x; // define a variable named x, of type int
```

**Instantiation** is a fancy word that means the object will be created and assigned a memory address. 
	- Variables must be instantiated before they can be used to store values.

- In C++, the type of a variable must be known at compile-time, and that type cannot be changed without recompiling the program
