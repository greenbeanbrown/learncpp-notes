# # 0.11 — Configuring your compiler: Warning and error levels

- If you have done something that definitively violates the rules of the language, during compilation the compiler will emit an error, providing both line number containing the error, and some text about what was expected vs what was found. 
	- The actual error may be on that line, or on a preceding line. 
	- Once you’ve identified and fixed the erroneous line(s) of code, you can try compiling again.
	- By default, most compilers will only generate warnings about the most obvious issues. - However, you can request your compiler be more assertive about providing warnings for things it finds strange.
