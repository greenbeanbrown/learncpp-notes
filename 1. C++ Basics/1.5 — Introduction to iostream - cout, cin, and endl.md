# 1.5 — Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

### The input/output library

The input/output library (io library) is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output. We’ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console. The _io_ part of _iostream_ stands for _input/output_.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// rest of code that uses iostream functionality here
```

### std:cout
- Use this to print to console
- Interesting because unlike Python, you actually assign the output to a variable 
	- This is called an **insertion operator**
	- Rather than call a print() function with the output as an input parameter

- To print more than one thing on the same line, the insertion operator (`<<`) can be used multiple times in a single statement to concatenate (link together) multiple pieces of output. 
	- For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
    return 0;
}
```

### std::endl
- This is the C++ standard library's equivalent of a newline character

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout and std::endl

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line of the console
    std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Output a newline whenever a line of output is complete.


### std::endl vs '\n'

- Using std::endl can be a bit inefficient, as it actually does two jobs: it moves the cursor to the next line, and it makes sure that the output shows up on the screen immediately (this is called flushing the output).
- Because of this, use of the newline character is typically preferred instead
	- Newline character does not request a flush

Here’s an example that uses ‘\n’ in two different ways:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // Using '\n' standalone
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n"; // Using '\n' embedded into a double-quoted piece of text (note: no single quotes when used this way)
    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Prefer ‘\n’ over std::endl when outputting text to the console.


### std::cin
- "character input"
- Rather that using an insertion operator (<<), we use an **extraction operator**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number

    int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
There’s some debate over whether it’s necessary to initialize a variable immediately before you give it a user provided value via another source (e.g. std::cin), since the user-provided value will just overwrite the initialization value. In line with our previous recommendation that variables should always be initialized, best practice is to initialize the variable first.
