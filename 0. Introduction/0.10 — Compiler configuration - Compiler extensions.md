# # 0.10 â€” Configuring your compiler: Compiler extensions

- The C++ standard defines rules about how programs should behave in specific circumstances. And in most cases, compilers will follow these rules. 
	- However, many compilers implement their own changes to the language, often to enhance compatibility with other versions of the language (e.g. C99), or for historical reasons.
- Frustratingly, compiler extensions are often enabled by default. 
	- This is particularly damaging for new learners, who may think some behavior that works is part of official C++ standard, when in fact their compiler is simply over-permissive.
