# 1.2 — Comments
A comment is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program. 
	- Comments are ignored by the compiler and are for the programmer’s use only.


### Single-line comments
The `//` symbol begins a C++ single-line comment, which tells the compiler to ignore everything from the _//_ symbol to the end of the line. For example:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to the end of the line is ignored
```


### Multi-line comments

The `/*` and `*/` pair of symbols denotes a C-style multi-line comment. Everything in between the symbols is ignored.

```cpp
/* This is a multi-line comment.
   This line will be ignored.
   So will this one. */
```

### Proper use of comments
Typically, comments should be used for three things:
	1.  For a given library, program, or function, comments are best used to describe WHAT the library/program/function does
		- Typically places at the top of the file or library, or immediately preceding a function
	2. Within a library, program, or function described above, comments can be used to describe HOW the code is going to accomplish its goal
	3. At the statement level, comments should be used to describe WHY the code is doing something
		- NOTE: a bad statement comment explains WHAT the code is doing...
			- If your code is so complex that it needs a comment to explain WHAT a statement is doing, you probably need to rewrite your statement, rather than comment it

#### Example:
**Bad comment:**

```cpp
// Set sight range to 0
sight = 0;
```

Reason: We already can see that sight is being set to 0 by looking at the statement

**Good comment:**

```cpp
// The player just drank a potion of blindness and can not see anything
sight = 0;
```

Reason: Now we know why the player’s sight is being set to 0
